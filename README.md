# The aplication
The web application we are going to develop is a user search using the GitHub REST API and the Vue.js frontend framework to provide a seamless user experience. 

The main functionality of this application will be to allow users to search for other users on GitHub using their username. Once a user is found, relevant information such as their name, avatar, followers, repositories, etc. will be displayed. 

A standout feature of this application is the ability to add and remove users to a favorites list. This will allow users to save profiles they find interesting and quickly access them in future sessions. 

To achieve this, we will utilize the browser's local storage to store the list of favorite users. This way, even if the user logs out or refreshes the page, the favorites list will remain intact. 

The development of this application will follow the practical DevOps methodology. This means that we will use best development practices, continuous integration, and automated deployment to ensure code quality and smooth implementation. 

The ultimate goal of this application is to provide users with an easy and convenient way to search and manage user profiles on GitHub, leveraging the power of Vue.js on the frontend and the GitHub REST API on the backend.
